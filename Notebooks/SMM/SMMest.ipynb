    "The code in this Jupyter notebook was written using Python 3.6. It also uses data file `data/Econ381totpts.txt` and the image file `images/MLEplots.png`. For the code to run properly, you should have the data file and the image fil in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook file. Otherwise, you will have to change the respective lines of the code that read in the data to reflect the location of that data."

    "## 1. The SMM estimator\n",
    "Simulated method of moments (SMM) is analogous to the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. SMM could really be thought of as a particular type of GMM estimator. The SMM estimator chooses model parameters $\\theta$ to make simulated model moments match data moments. Seminal papers developing SMM are McFadden (1989), Lee and Ingram (1991), and Duffie and Singleton (1993). Good textbook treatments of SMM are found in Adda and Cooper (2003, pp. 87-100) and Davidson and MacKinnon (2004, pp. 383-394).\n",
    "\n",
    "In ML estimation, we used data $x$ and model parameters $\\theta$ to maximize the likelihood of drawing that data $x$ from the model given parameters $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{\\theta}_{ML} = \\theta:\\quad \\max_{\\theta}\\ln\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^N\\ln\\Bigl(f(x_i|\\theta)\\Bigr) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In GMM estimation, we used data $x$ and model parameters $\\theta$ to minimize the distance between model moments $m(x|\\theta)$ and data moments $m(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{\\theta}_{GMM} = \\theta:\\quad \\min_{\\theta}||m(x|\\theta) - m(x)|| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The following difficulties can arise with GMM making it not possible or very difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model moment function $m(x|\\theta)$ is not known analytically.\n",
    "* The model moments $m(x|\\theta)$ are derived from *latent variables* that are not observed by the modeler. See Laroque and Salanie (1993).\n",
    "* The model moments $m(x|\\theta)$ are derived from *censored variables* that are only partially observed by the modeler.\n",
    "* The model moments $m(x|\\theta)$ are just difficult to derive analytically. Examples include moments that include multiple integrals over nonlinear functions as in McFadden (1989).\n",
    "\n",
    "SMM estimation is simply to simulate the model data $S$ times, and use the average values of the moments from the simulated data as the estimator for the model moments. Let $\\tilde{x}=\\{\\tilde{x}_1,\\tilde{x}_2,...\\tilde{x}_s,...\\tilde{x}_S\\}$ be the $S$ simulations of the model data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{m}\\left(\\tilde{x}|\\theta\\right) = \\frac{1}{S}\\sum_{s=1}^S m\\left(\\tilde{x}_s|\\theta\\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have an estimate of the model moments $\\hat{m}\\left(\\tilde{x}|\\theta\\right)$ from our $S$ simulations, SMM estimation is very similar to our presentation of GMM. The SMM approach of estimating the parameter vector $\\hat{\\theta}_{SMM}$ is to choose $\\theta$ to minimize some distance measure of the data moments $m(x)$ from the simulated model moments $\\hat{m}(\\tilde{x}|\\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{\\theta}_{SMM}=\\theta:\\quad \\min_{\\theta}\\: ||\\hat{m}(\\tilde{x}|\\theta)-m(x)|| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance measure $||\\hat{m}(\\tilde{x}|\\theta)-m(x)||$ can be any kind of norm. But it is important to recognize that your estimates $\\hat{\\theta}_{SMM}$ will be dependent on what distance measure (norm) you choose. The most widely studied and used distance metric in GMM and SMM estimation is the $L^2$ norm or the sum of squared errors in moments. Define the moment error function $e(\\tilde{x},x|\\theta)$ as the percent difference in the vector of simulated model moments from the data moments.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ e(\\tilde{x},x|\\theta) \\equiv \\frac{\\hat{m}(\\tilde{x}|\\theta)-m(x)}{m(x)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that the error function $e(\\tilde{x},x|\\theta)$ be a percent deviation of the moments (given that none of the data moments are 0). This puts all the moments in the same units, which helps make sure that no moments receive unintended weighting simply due to its units. This ensures that the problem is scaled properly and will suffer from as little as possible ill conditioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the SMM estimator is the following,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{\\theta}_{SMM}=\\theta:\\quad \\min_{\\theta}\\:e(\\tilde{x},x|\\theta)^T \\, W \\, e(\\tilde{x},x|\\theta) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W$ is a $R\\times R$ weighting matrix in the criterion function. For now, think of this weighting matrix as the identity matrix. But we will show in Section 2 a more optimal weighting matrix. We call the quadratic form expression $e(\\tilde{x},x|\\theta)^T \\, W \\, e(\\tilde{x},x|\\theta)$ the *criterion function* because it is a strictly positive scalar that is the object of the minimization in the SMM problem statement. The $R\\times R$ weighting matrix $W$ in the criterion function allows the econometrician to control how each moment is weighted in the minimization problem. For example, an $R\\times R$ identity matrix for $W$ would give each moment equal weighting, and the criterion function would be a simply sum of squared percent deviations (errors). Other weighting strategies can be dictated by the nature of the problem or model.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last item to emphasize with SMM, which we will highlight in the examples in this notebook, is that the errors that are drawn for the $S$ simulations of the model must be drawn only once so that the minimization problem for $\\hat{\\theta}_{SMM}$ does not have the underlying sampling changing for each guess of a value of $\\theta$. Put more simply, you want the random draws for all the simulations to be held constant so that the only thing changing in the minimization problem is the value of the vector of parameters $\\theta$."

You want to downweight moments that have a high variance, and you want to weight more heavily the moments that are generated more precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this definition of the optimal weighting matrix is circular. $W^{opt}$ is a function of the SMM estimates $\\hat{\\theta}_{SMM}$, but the optimal weighting matrix is used in the estimation of $\\hat{\\theta}_{SMM}$.

    "## 4. Identification\n",
    "An issue that we saw in the examples from the previous section is that there is some science as well as some art in choosing moments to identify the parameters in an SMM estimation as well as in GMM. Suppose the parameter vector $\\theta$ has $K$ elements, or rather, $K$ parameters to be estimated. In order to estimate $\\theta$ by GMM, you must have at least as many moments as parameters to estimate $R\\geq K$. If you have exactly as many moments as parameters to be estimated $R=K$, the model is said to be *exactly identified*. If you have more moments than parameters to be estimated $R>K$, the model is said to be *overidentified*. If you have fewer moments than parameters to be estimated $R<K$, the model is said to be *underidentified*. There are good reasons to overidentify $R>K$ the model in SMM estimation as we saw in the previous example. The main reason is that not all moments are orthogonal. That is, some moments convey roughly the same information about the data and, therefore, do not separately identify any extra parameters. So a good SMM model often is overidentified $R>K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last point about MM regards moment selection and verification of results. The real world has an infinite supply of potential moments that describe some part of the data. Choosing moments to estimate parameters by SMM requires understanding of the model, intuition about its connections to the real world, and artistry. A good SMM estimation will include moments that have some relation to or story about their connection to particular parameters of the model to be estimated. In addition, a good verification of a SMM estimation is to take some moment from the data that was not used in the estimation and see how well the corresponding moment from the estimated model matches that *outside moment*."

    "Indirect inference is a particular application of SMM with some specific characteristics. As moments to match it uses parameters of an auxiliary model that can be estimated both on the real-world data and on the simulated data. Smith (2008) gives a great summary of the topic with some examples. See also Gourieroux and Monfort (1996, ch. 4) for a textbook treatment of the topic."

When the auxiliary model is run on the $s$th simulation of the data given model parameters $g(\\tilde{x}_{s,t},\\tilde{z}_{s,t}|\\phi)=0$, the auxiliary model parameters are the $s$th estimate of the model moments $\\hat{\\phi}_s(\\tilde{x}_{s,t},\\tilde{z}_{s,t}|\\theta)$.

Other examples are probit, logit, and two-stage IV regressions. The key is that these statistics be computationally tractable and have convenient or accurate data availability."
